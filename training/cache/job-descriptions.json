We strike the best balance between having the culture of a small independent studio and the resources of a massive growth platform. \r\n\r\nIn blockchain technology, NFT is a non-fungible token (Non-Fungible Token), that is, unlike other tokens, which in the crypto world are something like an internal currency in video games, that cannot be exchanged for another token of this kind. The Metaverse has become a successful solution for the development of the NFT industry, which today is an integral part of some cryptocurrency projects. After all, in the center of it lies a lot of virtual things that surround users in a particular universe. These can be NFT paintings, furniture, avatars, clothes and accessories for them. Players want the game to have more features that go beyond the usual games. They want more digital experiences outside of the game. NFT makes it easy to transfer skins and other accessories between different games. \r\n\r\nNFT avatars are algorithmically generated digital images of cartoon or pixelated characters, usually from the shoulders up, that are in a “profile picture” format. Each NFT avatar is completely unique, with an array of distinguishing traits (i.e., clothing, hairstyles, accessories, etc.). The avatars can be cartoon animals, humans or abstract creatures, with fantasy and science fiction elements. \r\n\r\n**Specialization:** Blockchain, Gamedev\r\n**Headquarters:** Israel\r\n**Years on the market:** since 2021\r\n\r\n**Previous experience:**\r\n-4+ years experience in game, VR/AR, or film-related industries as a 3D artist or similar.\r\n-A portfolio of work must be available for review, displaying examples of various elements such as 3D character models.\r\n-Complete understanding of modeling, texturing, and optimization of assets for Unity.\r\n-Experience with Maya or Max, Zbrush, Photoshop, and equivalent software.\r\n-Strong understanding of asset pipelines and agile development environments.\r\n-Experience with secondary areas such as rigging, VFX, animation, or lighting.\r\n-Expert knowledge of high to low poly processes\r\n-Attention to detail and problem-solving\r\n-Excellent communication skills\r\n-Upper-Intermediate English\r\n\r\n**You are a rock star if you have:**\r\n-Solid foundation in art fundamentals of composition, design, lighting, etc.\r\n-Passion and constant drive to stay up to date with the latest technologies and techniques.\r\n-Scripting, rigging, and/or artist tool creation.\r\n\r\n**Scope of work:**\r\nThe 3D Artist will be part of a new and growing team responsible for creating 3D assets on the MetaVegas application.\r\n\r\n-Creating models and textures for environments, props and characters under the art lead’s supervision.\r\n-Collaborate with team members of other disciplines to meet milestone goals.\r\n-Work closely with production to define deliverables and communicate expectations.\r\n-Assist in R&D efforts.\r\n-Troubleshoot technical and artistic issues.\r\n\r\n**WHY DO YOU NEED TO CHOOSE AllSTARSIT?**\r\n- Environment for development and growth(we have a learning and development program for each employee);\r\n- More than a competitive salary;\r\n- A friendly international team of professionals;\r\n- Cozy office at Gulliver Business Center in Kyiv with car parking, a music room, and free lunches;\r\n- Flexible working conditions(starting from 8 to 11 am, 8-hour workday); remote, office, or hybrid;\r\n- Free language classes(English, Spanish, Hebrew);\r\n- Corporate trips abroad,workations and team-buildings;\r\n- Personal wellness consultant.\r\n\r\n**If you are looking for a remote ‘home’ to bring your 3D Art skills and experience, look no further.
