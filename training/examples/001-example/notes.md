# Example Notes

## Why This Is a Gold Standard

1. **Summary**: each summary outlines the key story of the employee such as time in domain etc without taking away from the metrics and skills, includes some keywords and skills but leaves the rest to the bullets

2. **Experience Selection**: I selected a mix of operations roles and fraud roles as those are the 2 strongest categories for me in terms of career and also will show diversity in experience
3. **Bullet Quality**: Bullet quality is based on structuring of bullets in relation to description good inferrences good metrics, good domain knowledge
4. **Skills**: skills should always include skills that align with JD as well as skills that are highly technical or universal such as SQL, python, and more broadly google suite, office suite with being able to infer that those could mean the products within  or similar products or product types

## What Should NOT Appear

- things that dont align with the job description IF there are other bullets or experiences within other work experiences the user has that do align, if not its ok to have most recent jobs with decent bullets if there arent better things to add. must make that distinction
- Example: "Satterberg Foundation role excluded - nonprofit grant management doesn't align with fraud/fintech domain"
