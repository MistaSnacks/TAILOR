## FAQ Copy

### Q1: How does the RAG technology work?

**Answer:**  

TAILOR uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground AI in your real experience.

1. We parse your resumes and work docs into structured data: experiences, bullets, and skills.  
2. When you paste a job description, we semantically match it against your profile to find the most relevant bullets and roles—even when the wording is different.  
3. The AI then writes a tailored resume using only your real history, following our templates and quality rules so the output stays truthful and ATS-friendly.

### Q2: Is my data secure?

**Answer:**  

We take your career data seriously.

- Your information is scoped to your account with strict access controls.  
- We only send the minimum necessary context to the AI model to generate your resume.  
- You can delete your account and associated data at any time.  

(As you finalize infra and policies, you can add details about encryption, hosting, and compliance here.)

---

### Q3: Can I edit the generated resume?

**Answer:**  

Absolutely. TAILOR gives you a tailored, ATS-ready starting point—but you stay in control.

- Edit any bullet, summary, or section directly in the app.  
- Hide or show roles depending on what you want to highlight.  
- Download as PDF or DOCX once you’re happy with it.  

Think of TAILOR as your AI editor, not a black box.

### Q4: Does it work for all industries?

**Answer:**  

TAILOR is designed to work across industries, with a special focus on knowledge work—tech, product, operations, finance, consulting, and similar roles.

Because everything is grounded in your own experience and the actual job description, TAILOR adapts to different titles and functions instead of forcing a one-size-fits-all template.

---

### Q5: Is TAILOR good for people affected by layoffs?

**Answer:**  

Yes—TAILOR is built with laid-off and transitioning professionals in mind.

- Upload multiple old resumes, job descriptions, and work docs.  
- Quickly generate different versions of your resume for adjacent roles (e.g., ops vs product ops vs risk/fraud).  
- Keep your narrative coherent and confident, even if your path has been disrupted.  

When you’re suddenly applying to many jobs, TAILOR helps you move faster without losing the quality of your story.
